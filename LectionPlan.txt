2) Write console app with these methods(use console for results output)
 - defining all types of primitives and initializing them;
 - casting for all types of primitives(explicit, implicit);
 - using all methods of string for some string value for instance "Hello world!";
 - write at least 5 types and use theirs object derived methods;
 - write five methods with implicit typing;
 - write 2 methods with using every c# construction;
